Aim:Write a Java program to create an Employee class where an Overloaded constructor initializes employee details.The default constructor should Initialize name as "Unknown" and salary as 0 and the second constructor initializes the name and sets a default salary.  Create a method DisplayEmployeeDetails() to display employee information.

Code:
// Employee class
class Employee {
    String name;
    double salary;

    // Default constructor
    public Employee() {
        this.name = "Unknown";
        this.salary = 0;
    }

    // Overloaded constructor
    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = 5000; // Default salary when only name is provided
    }

    // Method to display employee details
    public void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + salary);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating Employee objects using both constructors
        Employee emp1 = new Employee(); // Using default constructor
        Employee emp2 = new Employee("John Doe"); // Using overloaded constructor with name

        // Displaying employee details
        System.out.println("Employee 1 Details:");
        emp1.displayEmployeeDetails();
        System.out.println();

        System.out.println("Employee 2 Details:");
        emp2.displayEmployeeDetails();
    }
}

Output:
Employee 1 Details:
Employee Name: Unknown
Employee Salary: 0.0

Employee 2 Details:
Employee Name: John Doe
Employee Salary: 5000.0
